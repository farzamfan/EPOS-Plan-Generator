# I-EPOS-PlanGenerator

This project can be used to create I-EPOS compatible plan files from users' schedules.
This is used for the "Appliance-Level Flexible Scheduling for Socio-Technical Smart Grid Optimisation" paper.

#------------
Code and project
#------------

This code can be used in order create plans from the raw files, generated by the users' scheduling agents.
The scheduling agent is a android mobile applicaion, to collect users' schedules and flexibilty in appliance usage.

main class is: package ETHZ.Scheduler.Plan.java

Scripts
#------------

aggregateCSV.R: creates aggregate .csv files from users appliance-level schedules

aggregateCSV-wExclusion.R: creates aggregate .csv files from users appliance-level schedules, incorporating appliance exclusion
	This corresponds to the "Impact of Individual Appliances on Demand Response" experiments (Section 6.3.2)

aggregateCSVREFIT.R: modify the kettle plans by reducing the energy consumption around the peak times.
	This corresponds to the "Increased Efficiency vs Optimised Flexible Scheduling" experiments (Section 6.3.3)

aggregateCSV-jKettle.R: sets the flexibility of all appliances, except the kettle, to zero.
	This corresponds to the "Increased Efficiency vs Optimised Flexible Scheduling" experiments (Section 6.3.3)
